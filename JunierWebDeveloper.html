A dentist can charge $300 to $400 for a Dental Filling in USA & Europe. It costs only $20 to $40 in India. A Root Canal is $1,500 in the West but only $100 to $200 in India. Dentures can cost $1000 overseas but only $200 in India.

Dentistry is a growing industry with 13,000 practicing dentists in the US. However, at the same time it is not affordable by average citizens due to the expensive Dental Care Services. Dental treatment is generally not reimbursed by the National Health Schemes of some countries and is too expensive.

The difference in charge of a Dentist from US to India is worth a thought. That is why India has recently become a major tourist hub of Dental Care Solutions. You can have your tooth fixed and make your holidays memorable at the same time or simply, enjoy the different hues of Mystic India and get the Dental treatment done without getting a hole in your pocket.
